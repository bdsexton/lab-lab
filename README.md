# Link and Bookmark Lab

Link- and Bookmark-Related Experiments, etc.

## Background

I have long been interested in links, bookmarks, taxonomy, indexing and searching, user interfaces, user experiences, and related topics. I have even had some link directories of my own. I would like to explore some of these topics again and see if I might be able to make some useful contributions, whether in the form of analysis and recommendations, utilities, libraries, or otherwise.

## Topics for Consideration

### Bookmarks

I have never liked how Google Chrome handles bookmarks: no tags, no searching/filtering when adding new bookmarks, and a ridiculously long menu on macOS. I wonder if there is anything I can do to improve it or at least mitigate its irritations.

I am not fond of multiple URLs being used for the same content, which can result in duplicate bookmarks for individuals and possibly some difficulty for indexers. Urchin Tracking Module (UTM) codes and similar schemes in Medium and Facebook URLs sacrifice URL tidiness (and thus their readers' link and bookmark tidiness) for tracking information.
